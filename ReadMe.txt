This repository contains the implementation of CPRG304 Assignment 2, which involves creating custom Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and data structures including a stack, queue, array list, and doubly linked list. These implementations were developed in Java and adhere to provided interface specifications. Additionally, the project includes an XML parser that validates the structure of XML documents using the custom data structures. All functionalities were tested thoroughly with JUnit to ensure correctness and reliability. The project demonstrates key concepts of object-oriented programming, algorithm design, and data structure implementation. Detailed documentation is available in the doc folder, and the application can be executed by running the provided Parser.jar.
